Finite State machines with Python Coroutines

Finite state machines are simulate sequential logic and some computer programs, Finite state machines can be used to model problems in many fields including mathematics, artificial intelligence, games, and linguistics.

# Conclusion
Even though this may not be the most efficinet way to implement and build FSM but it is most intuitive way indeed. The edges and state transitions translate well into `if` and `elif`, each state is modelled as an independant co-routines and we still do things in a sequential manner. It feels parallel but it is infact sequential.

More like passing the parcel.
