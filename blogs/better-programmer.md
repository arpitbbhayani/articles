"How to get better at programming?" was the question I had been asked quite a few times, and today I lay down the principles I have been following, and action items against each, since 2012 to be good and get better at what I do.

# Code exhaustively
Doing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop our ability to

 - write code while we think
 - think faster, think better
 - foresee requirement changes and possible logic extensions

### Action Items

 - One significant contribution to a project every two weeks
 - Solve at least two programming questions (from [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Spoj](https://www.spoj.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) every week, till we solve at least 300 questions

# Code consistently
If we don't do something repeatedly, it becomes extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps us

 - define the programatic and algorithmic flow quickly
 - build a habit of programming and thinking analytically

### Action Items

 - make one small contribution to any one project every three days

# Build complex systems
Solving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when we build a complex system, as it requires us to take our programming skills go up a notch. Some examples of complex systems are - a Library management system, a [Twitter](https://twitter.com) clone, an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) clone, etc. Building a complex system

 - widens our tech stack
 - makes us keep our code flexible, extensible and reusable
 - helps us understand how to split our code into independent segments that work in harmony

### Action Items

 - build one complex system every 4 months

# Build something inspired by the real world
After we spend some time writing programs and solving problems, things become monotonus and does not seem to challenge us anymore, so to spice things up a bit we should model something from the real world, like

  - [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion)
  - [double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum)
  - [solar system simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_model_of_the_Solar_System)

There are lots of libraries and framework like [p5.js](https://p5js.org) that makes visual programming simple.

### Action Items

 - once every 6 months model a physical phenomenon

# Read super exhaustively
It is not only writing code that improves our programming skills but it is reading some quality code written by expert programmers that makes the difference. Reading code written by experts improve our programming vocabulary and by doing this we

 - learn the best programming practices
 - discover the new programming paradigms
 - find ways to properly structure our code for extensibility

The best way to start doing it is by picking up an open-source project and start skimming the code. It is okay to not understand it in the first go but it is important to skim it a few times and get acquainted. After a few skims, everything will fall in place, the code becomes familiar and we start to understand the flow and business logic.

### Action Items

 - pick an open-source project every 6 months and skim its code once every two months
 - pick a tiny open-source utility, from an experienced developer, every month and skim it

# Collaborate with a stranger
There is always someone sitting on the other side of the globe, who knows a thing or two more than you. Find that person and collaborate on a project of your choice. The developer community is superb and everyone loves to share and collaborate. Use communities like Dev.to and Hashnode to find like-minded people.

### Action Items

 - Be active on platforms like Dev.to and Hashnode
 - Collaborate with someone on a small utility project once a year

# Fundamentals go a long way
A programming language is just a tool to express your logic so while learning the programming language we should also understand the constructs and paradigms. We could pick constructs from one language and use it in another. For example: using Callback pattern from Javascript into Python for writing generic action functions.

### Action Items

 - Learn one design pattern every month and build some simulation with it
 - Pick a language construct and implement it in some other language

# Think before you code
As a developer, we like to code, but writing code without putting in much of a thought worsens it - the code loses its reusability and becomes spaghetti. Spending some time thinking about problem statement or task at hand and creating a rough plan always helps.

### Action Items

 - Before implementing, define the scope of implementation, create a rough roadmap and then code

# Conclusion
It is not necessary to act on every single action item specified. It totally depends on what interests you. Programming is simple but being good at it is difficult. The path to becoming a better programmer is never bursty rather steady. I hope these points help you be a better programmer; it surely has helped me a lot.
