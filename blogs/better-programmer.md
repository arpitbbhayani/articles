"How to get better at programming?" was the question I had been asked quite a few times, and today I lay down the principles I have been following, and action items against each, since 2012 to be good and get better at what I do.

# Code exhaustively
Doing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop our ability to

 - write code while we think
 - think faster, think better
 - foresee requirement changes and possible logic extensions

### Action Items

 - One significant contribution to a project in two weeks
 - Solve at least 2 programming questions (from [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Spoj](https://www.spoj.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) every week, till we solve at least 300 questions

# Code consistently
If you don't do something repeatedly, it becomes extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps you

 - builds a habit of programming
 - tune left half of your brain for programming constructs and analytical thinking

### Action Items

 - Make one small contribution to any of your project a day

# Build complex systems
Solving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when you'll have to build complex systems and this requires your programming to go up a notch. For examples of complex systems are - a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system is essential and it

 - widens your tech stack
 - makes you keep your code flexible and extensible
 - forces you to write and structure your code such that it is reusable
 - helps you understand how different segments of your code work in harmony

### Action Items

 - build one complex system every 4 months

# Once a while build something inspired by the real world
After a certain stage writing programs restricted to computer science domain (like Data Structures and Algorithms or some Management systems) does not challenge you anymore then to spice things up a bit you should model something from the real world like

  - [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion)
  - [double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum)
  - [solar system simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_model_of_the_Solar_System)

### Action Items

 - Once every 6 months try to model a physical phenomenon

# Read thrice the amount of code you write
It is not only writing that improves your programming skills but reading some quality code written by an expert programmer helps a ton. The best way to start doing it is by picking up an open-source project (in your favorite programming language) and just start going through it. It is okay to not understand it fully but skimming it a few times will improve your programming vocabulary and broaden your horizon. By doing this you

 - learn best programming practices
 - discover new programming paradigms
 - find ways to properly structure your code for extensibility

### Action Items

 - Pick a popular open-source project every 6 months and skim its code once every two months
 - Pick a tiny open-source utility every month, from an experienced developer and skim its once every month

# Collaborate with stranger
There is always someone sitting on the other side of the globe, who knows a thing or two more than you. Find that person and collaborate on a project of your choice. The developer community is superb and everyone loves to share and collaborate. Use communities like Dev.to and Hashnode to find like-minded people.

### Action Items

 - Be active on platforms like Dev.to and Hashnode
 - Collaborate with someone on a small utility project once a year

# Fundamentals go a long way
A programming language is just a tool to express your logic so while learning the programming language we should also understand the constructs and paradigms. We could pick constructs from one language and use it in another. For example: using Callback pattern from Javascript into Python for writing generic action functions.

### Action Items

 - Learn one design pattern every month and build some simulation with it
 - Pick a language construct and implement it in some other language

# Think before you code
As a developer, we like to code, but writing code without putting in much of a thought worsens it - the code loses its reusability and becomes spaghetti. Spending some time thinking about problem statement or task at hand and creating a rough plan always helps.

### Action Items

 - Before implementing, define the scope of implementation, create a rough roadmap and then code

# Conclusion
Programming is simple but being good at it is difficult. The path to becoming a better programmer is never bursty rather steady. I hope these points help you be a better programmer; it surely has helped me a lot.
