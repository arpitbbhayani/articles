"How do I become a better programmer?" is the question that have been asked the most to me; and today I want to lay down the principles I have been following for last 10 years, to be better at what I do

# Write a shit ton of code
Doing something repeatedly always helps. Writing a lot of code will help you think faster annd better. Mistakes you made before will be rectified in future.

# Write code consistently
Doing it in burst will not help. Doint it consistent will.

# Once a while build something inspired from real world
It is easy to code programs that are from the computer science domain or uses entties from CS world. But it is relatively complex to model something that exists in real life and code it in

  - projectile motion
  - double pendulum
  - solar system
  - exclipse prediction

It will make yyou research before yyou write.

# Write complex systems
Once you are confident on writing simple systtems/porograms take up complex project/large project. It will help you split your code btter. reusing compenents. it will build that intuition.

# Read twice shit ton of code
Often practicve elps but one of the most underrated thing is to read a cide wriutten by exoeruence programmers. Read open-source tech code. And you will definitely learn something new and better.

# Collaborate with peers
Learning from peers is the best. There is always something that your peers know better; learn from them ask for help.

# Fundamentals go a long way
Not just learn one tech/langauge. Learn the fundamentals. It will go the long wayy. You could crossapply your learnings.

 - using callback pattern from Javascript into Python


# Thinking it through
Sharpen the axe before cutting the tree
