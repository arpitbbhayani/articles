"How do I become a better programmer?" is the question that have been asked the most to me; and today I want to lay down the principles I have been following, and action items against each, for the last 10 years to be good and get better at what I do.

# Write a shit ton of code
Doing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop an ability to

 - think faster, think better
 - foresee requirement changes and possible extensions
 - write code while you think (for simpler business logic)

### Action Items

 - One significant contribution to any one of your project in a week
 - Solve 3 programming questions (on sites like Codechef, Spoj, Leetcode, etc) every week, till you solve at least 300 questions

# Write code consistently
If you don't do something repeatedly, it become extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps you

 - builds a habit of programming
 - tune left half of your brain for programming constructs and analytical thinking

### Action Items

 - Make one small contribution to any of your project a day

# Build complex systems
Solving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when you'll have to build complex systems and this requires your programming to go up a notch. For examples of complex systems are: a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system is essential and it

 - widens your tech stack
 - makes you keep your code flexible and extensible
 - forces you to write and structure your code such that it is reusable
 - helps you understand how different segments of your code work in harmony

### Action Items

 - build one complex system every 4 months

# Once a while build something inspired from real world
After a certain stage writing programs restricted to computer science domain (like Data Structures and Algorithms or some Management systems) becomes a piece of cake. To take your programming to the next level you should model something from the real world like

  - [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion)
  - [double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum)
  - [solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_model_of_the_Solar_System) simulation

### Action Items

# Read twice shit ton of code
Contrary to popular opinion, it is not only writing but also reading quality code by expert programmer helps a lot. I would recommend, you

 - read open-source code

This helps you

 - discover new programming paradigms that you could later use in your code,
 - find ways to structure code for extensibility
 - learn best practices while writing code

### Action Items

# Collaborate with peers
It is always adisable to do pair programming or collaborate on a same project with someone who stays on the other side of the globe. This is important because you will learn a ton of new things when you do so. There is always something that your peers know better; learn from them ask for help. This is a quick way to learn and get your doubts fixed and build relationships.

Lately I have been collaborating with @burnns and I have learned so many new nthings and practices from him and it has helped me

### Action Items

# Fundamentals go a long way
Learningg program is not vbounded by a particular language. So learn fundamentals and make language a tool. It will go the long wayy. You could crossapply your learnings.

 - using callback pattern from Javascript into Python

### Action Items

# Thinking it through
Given a problem statement, do not just dive to write program. Think. Fir finalize the requirement, draw rough sketch of the system. see if you make something better. And then code.

A well planned implementation makes your coding phase a breeze.

### Action Items


# Conclusion
Just compete with yourself and see that you are improving. Steady growth is important. Preefer consistency than bursty behaviour.
