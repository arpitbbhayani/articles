"How do I become a better programmer?" is the question that have been asked the most to me; and today I want to lay down the principles I have been following, and action items against each, for the last 10 years to be good and get better at what I do.

# Write a shit ton of code
Doing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop an ability to

 - think faster, think better
 - foresee requirement changes and possible extensions
 - write code while you think (for simpler business logic)

### Action Items

 - One significant contribution to any one of your project in a week
 - Solve 3 programming questions (on sites like Codechef, Spoj, Leetcode, etc) every week, till you solve at least 300 questions

# Write code consistently
If you don't do something repeatedly, it become extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps you

 - builds a habit of programming
 - tune left half of your brain for programming constructs and analytical thinking

### Action Items

 - Make one small contribution to any of your project a day

# Build complex systems
Solving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when you'll have to build complex systems and this requires your programming to go up a notch. For examples of complex systems are: a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system is essential and it

 - widens your tech stack
 - makes you keep your code flexible and extensible
 - forces you to write and structure your code such that it is reusable
 - helps you understand how different segments of your code work in harmony

### Action Items

 - build one complex system every 4 months

# Once a while build something inspired from real world
After a certain stage writing programs restricted to computer science domain (like Data Structures and Algorithms or some Management systems) does not challenge you anymore then to spice things up a bit you should model something from the real world like

  - [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion)
  - [double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum)
  - [solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_model_of_the_Solar_System) simulation

### Action Items

 - Once every 6 months try to model a physical phenomenon

# Read twice shit ton of code
It is not only writing that improves your programming skills but reading some quality code written by expert programmer helps a ton. The best way to start doing it is by picking up an open source project (in your favourite programming language) and just start going through it. It is okay to not understand it fully but skimming it a few times will improve your programming vocabulary and broaden your horizon. By doing this you

 - discover new programming paradigms
 - find ways to properly structure your code for extensibility
 - learn best programming practices

### Action Items

# Collaborate with peers
It is always adisable to do pair programming or collaborate on a same project with someone who stays on the other side of the globe. This is important because you will learn a ton of new things when you do so. There is always something that your peers know better; learn from them ask for help. This is a quick way to learn and get your doubts fixed and build relationships.

Lately I have been collaborating with @burnns and I have learned so many new nthings and practices from him and it has helped me

### Action Items

# Fundamentals go a long way
Learningg program is not vbounded by a particular language. So learn fundamentals and make language a tool. It will go the long wayy. You could crossapply your learnings.

 - using callback pattern from Javascript into Python

### Action Items

# Thinking it through
Given a problem statement, do not just dive to write program. Think. Fir finalize the requirement, draw rough sketch of the system. see if you make something better. And then code.

A well planned implementation makes your coding phase a breeze.

### Action Items


# Conclusion
Just compete with yourself and see that you are improving. Steady growth is important. Preefer consistency than bursty behaviour.
