Anomaly detection is a very common problem

Today we take an indepth look at [Isolation Forest](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf) algorithm for anomaly detection.

The algorithm is beautifully crafted by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting and Zhi-Hua Zhou. I am elaborating it in-depth just because I have loved how they have developed a different yet better approach to this age-old problem.

# Defining the problem statement
Anomalies are data patterns that have different data char-acteristics from normal instances
