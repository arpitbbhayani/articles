Binary search is one of the most famous algorithm. It makes searching super efficient when the numbers in the list are sorted. It explots the property so well. that it makes lsearching for the document`log(n)` which means we do not need to visit each and every element of the array to find the number.

BInary Search also outputs the position at which the number could be inserted.

In Python binary search could be implemented as

```py
import bisect

def binary_search(arr, q):
    return bisect.bisect_left(arr, q)
```

# The two extremes

## k - binary searches

## Merge all in one

# Fractional Cascading

## Preprocessinf

## Working

## Code

## Time and space complexity

## The more interesting part

### Why does we need to only check for the element and one before?

### Instead of doing it for alternate and not all?

### What if we do one in three
