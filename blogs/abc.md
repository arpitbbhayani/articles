Would you shave your head and get it tattooed? Probably no, but a slave in ancient Greece was made to do so in the 440 BCE by a ruler named Histiaeus. The text that was tattooed was a secret message that Histiaeus wanted to send to his son-in-law Aristagoras in Miletus. The slave was made to go to Miletus only after his hair grew back. Upon his arrival, the head was shaved again and the message was revealed which told Aristagoras to revolt against the Persians and start the Ionian revolt.

This art of concealing message is called Steganography. The word is derived from the Greek word “στεγαυω” which means "secret writing". In modern times, steganography can be looked into as the study of the art and science of communicating in a way that hides the presence of the communication.

Steganography continued over time to develop into new levels. Physical Steganography in which information is hidden in some physical form ex: Invisible Ink, Microdot, Postal Stamps, etc.

Digital steganography manipulates digital medium/carrier like Images, Audio, Video, Network Packets, DNA, Quantum, etc to conceal information. There are a bunch of techniques in each of the mentioned segment but in this article, we will focus on Image Steganography.

# Conclusion

This is the first article in the series of Steganography that detailed out Image Steganography. I hope you reaped some benefits out of it. The future articles on Steganography will talk about how Steganography is done on carriers like Audio, Network, DNA and Quantum states and will also dive into one of the most interesting applications of Steganography - a Steganographic File System. So stay tuned and watch this space for more.
