Would you shave your head and get it tattooed? Probably no, but a slave in ancient Greece was made to do so in the 5th century BCE by Histiaeus. The text that was tattooed was a secret message that Histiaeus wanted to send to his son-in-law Aristagoras in Miletus. The slave was made to go to Miletus only after his hair grew back. upon his arrival, the head was again shaved and the message was revealed. This was one of the earliest records of steganography - the art of hiding message.

The word “steganography” can be defined as “covered writing” or the technique of hiding messages inside other messages. It is derived from the Greek word “στεγαυω”. In modern times, steganography can be looked into as the study of the art and science of communicating in a way which hides the presence of the communication.
