Not everyone likes their head to be shaved and tattooed, but a slave in ancient Greece was made to shave his head and got his scalp tattooed with some text by Histiaeus in the 5th century BCE. The text that was tattooed was a secret message that he wanted to send to his son-in-law Aristagoras in Miletus. The slave was made to go to Miletus only after his hair grew back and this was one of the earliest records of steganography - the art of hiding message.

The word “steganography” can be defined as “covered writing” or the technique of hiding messages inside other messages. It is derived from the Greek word “στεγαυω”.
