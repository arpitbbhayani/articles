Would you shave your head and get it tattooed? Probably no, but a slave in ancient Greece was made to do so in the 440 BCE by Histiaeus. The text that was tattooed was a secret message that Histiaeus wanted to send to his son-in-law Aristagoras in Miletus. The slave was made to go to Miletus only after his hair grew back. upon his arrival, the head was again shaved and the message was revealed. This was one of the earliest records of steganography - the art of hiding message.

The word “steganography” can be defined as “covered writing” or the technique of hiding messages inside other messages. It is derived from the Greek word “στεγαυω”. In modern times, steganography can be looked into as the study of the art and science of communicating in a way that hides the presence of the communication.

# Physical Steganography

As you have seen from the example above, Steganography is not something new but has been around for thousands of years. Let me walk you through some of the fascinating examples:

### World War II

In WWII, the French Resistance sent some messages written on the backs of couriers using invisible ink.

### German Microdots
During and after World War II, espionage agents used photographically produced microdots to send information back and forth.Microdots were typically minute, approximately less than the size of the period produced by a typewriter. WWII microdots needed to be embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive (such as collodion). This was reflective and thus detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting microdots into slits cut into the edge of postcards.

During World War II the Germans introduced microdots. The microdots were complete documents, pictures, and plans reduced in size to the size of a period and attached to common paperwork

### Secret Ink
Invisible Ink involved common sources, this included milk, vinegar, fruit juice, and urine, for the hidden text.  To decipher these hidden messages required light or heat.
