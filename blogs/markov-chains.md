Markov Chain is a mathematical system that models any behaviour that is guided by probabilistic transitions. It finds its application in fields like Game Theory, Text Generators, Finance, Ranking Algorithms, and many more. In this article we dive into what Markov Chains are, see them in action and find what question does it answer.

# Markov Chain
Markov chain is a system of `N` discrete states such that it exists in any one of the state at a given time instant and could transitions into another state using from probabilistic rules.

## Transition Matrix
AB Transition

## Markov Property
Markov Chain while transitioning does not care about the trajectory taken (past) by the system to reach the present state, and it makes the decision independetly. This is Markov Property.

It means thatXt+1depends uponXt, but it does not depend uponXtâˆ’1,. . . , X1, X0

## Random Walk
There is a particle moving along the integer number line  bounded between [-5, 5]. The discrete state that the particle could be in are values -5, -4, -3, ..., 0, ..., 3, 4, 5. At every time instant the particle can either go 1 step to the right or 1 step to the left, with equal probabilities.

The system starts with s = 0.
