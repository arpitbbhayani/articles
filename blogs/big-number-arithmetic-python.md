One of the most virtue of Python is its
Python supports a "bignum" integer type which can work with arbitrarily large numbers.

While in C you have to think about limits of a `int` or `long` datatype and worry about using `signed` or `unsigned` to further extend it w.r.t your use case, Python makes our lives much much simpler. It supports arbitrarily large numberswhich means you could also do arithmetic on numbers that are greater indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system.

Even though python is implemented in C language, but still how it does this arithmetic?
