{"text":"Old English did not have a past tense for \"go\".\n\nThere was a verb \"wend\" (synonym of go) meaning \"go in a specific direction\". Because of direction it had, \"went\" was a perfect past tense for both words.\n\nIt's also why we have bad/worse, good/better, and be/am.\n\n#TIL #Etymology"}
