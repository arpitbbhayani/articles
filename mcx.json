			"message": "This course was the highlight of my weekends for the past two months. I’ve been exploring system design content for quite some time and after going through a lot of content, I must say Arpit does full justice to the time people invest in his course. Arpit does not shy about going to a detailed analysis of any system, he makes sure that every possible doubt that comes into your mind is resolved during the session and later in the open forum session. I found this very useful as Arpit’s extensive background in industry and academia gives him the ability to go as in-depth as you want when answering your questions. Be it databases’ internal implementation, operating system quirks or hardcore computer architecture question, Arpit knows his stuff really well.\n\nSmall cohort size and interactive brainstorming sessions helped me to get quick feedback on my design decisions. This made sure that the session was not just a one-sided lecture but an exchange of ideas amongst the peers. The cohort had people form different domains and varying experience - I used to search for the technologies and jargons people floated in the discussion which gave me an amazing exposure.\n\nInitially, I joined this course to become comfortable in system design interviews but later I realised that the main intention of the course is core engineering and detailed analysis of systems, which you might miss if you’re simply studying system design for interview purposes. Cracking interviews is a favourable byproduct of this course and not the sole intention. Thanks Arpit, I thoroughly enjoyed this course.",

He wouldn't straight up give you a solution with random jargon nor would he recommend using one technology over other without proper reasoning. He rather conducts brainstorming sessions where he nudges us to come up with solution. While doing so, he discusses the tradeoffs, he encourages to see the patterns and reuse the solutions discussed/built in the previous classes.\n\nI highly recommend taking this course.

Despite there being \"too many sources for system design on the Internet\" as people say, I haven't seen a single course or educator talk about an in-depth dissection of a given system and questioning different alternatives for even small micro-decisions, which are very critical and which Arpit covers in great depth for all the problem statements.\n\nThe aim throughout the course is to build intuition and a strong foundation. With a cohort-based model, learning increases multiple folds and it feels like a day-to-day technical discussion that you have with senior folks at work, which makes it the most fun part of all.\n\nThere are people with varied experiences here, and you get to learn from their experiences as well as get to connect with them, which is an added advantage. The \"cost - driven development\" mantra, as Arpit says in every design discussion, is an aspect that I have seen no one touch upon, and it is something that leads to very exciting discussions and approaches.\n\nArpit's energy and passion for computer science are infectious and something that rubs off on everyone in the cohort, leading to great brainstorming sessions. I would personally recommend this course to anyone who loves backend engineering and computer science in general to be a part of great technical discussions, not just for the sake of interview preparation, but to learn and have fun while building systems!\n\nAt least I did for the same reason :)",

Seeing youtube videos / reading articles or theory doesn't make sense till the time you actually solve a problem.

			"message": "I will start from the beginning. I have been following Arpit on LinkedIn, reading his blogs and YouTube videos, etc., since quite some time. What really struck out to me was the fact in every video he was covering topics that were not usually covered by people who were targetting for interviews. Just take a look at his CPython tutorials on YouTube and you will undestand what I mean. You could see genuine interest for engineering and breaking things apart to understand how they work only to put it back together and build it again from the scratch. This is what really caught my interest. You don't see that interest usually in other engineering or CS related blogs. This course was no different. \n\nRight from the beginning he made it pretty clear this is not some course you would use for your interview prep but rather expand upon your software engineering understanding. Even before day 1, he shared topics and reading material saying that you should come prepared after reading these topics in order to understand whats going to be discussed in the classes. The best part that I liked about his classes were, that he approached every system design problem with a Day 0 approach and then build upon the scaling part. I mean, it was not like \"Hey, this is the most optimal solution with some jargon thrown around\", but rather, \"This is our problem, lets build the most basic solution possible, and then try to scale it up and understand concepts while we do that.\". His energy is downright contagious when he is explaining difficult topics. I have seen him answer the most basic questions and go to extreme lengths to explain rather difficult topics in a very basic manner. My favourite lecture by far was Distributed ID Generators. Such a simple concept, such a simple design and he just nails every concept in the head. You would genuinely be amazed at his ability to spark that curiosity inside of you to search for the solution yourself.\n\nAdditionally, he takes effort to make the class as engaging as possible. It's not like, he will go on blabbering for 2-3 hours continuously and take questions or queries in the end. No, he makes sure that people are engaged, he keeps asking questions about the solution, poking holes and making us question the design ourselves. You must have heard about some Physics/Chemistry/Maths teachers who make the class so interesting and genuinely develop curiosity for those subjects in the students mind. Arpit, does exactly that for system design. He genuinely has a passion for teaching. \n\nI really enjoyed my time in this course. There are lot of things that I have to learn from my end to fully grasp the concepts and implement the concepts that I learned, and thanks to Arpit, I know where to look for them now :D \n\nTo summarize, 12/10 would highly recommend this course :D.",

			"message": "TLDR - Arpit's enthusiasm!\n\nHowever, if you want my detailed testimonial it is below.\n\nTop to bottom approach based learning - Instead of learning what cache is, what load balancer is. He picks a problem, designs a solution that is acceptable for Day 0, then introduces failures using scale/reliability/... and introduces these components to solve the failures.\n\nArpit neither spoon feeds you nor gives you just an overview of things. He explains concepts that are theoretical (for example: log based file system) and pushes you to experiment few things to learn yourself (for example: reservation systems using different kinds of locks). Arpit wants you to feel the same magic he felt when implementing these systems.\n\nEvery problem feels like a typical interview question and answer, but he has some gotchas or wow moments which make you realize this is so cool (from his past experience). And best part is he tries to push everyone in this direction and make them answer instead of giving the answer away.\n\nArpit also explains the philosophical side of engineering, why you shouldn't over engineer things on Day 0, how technology inspires from real-world (he explained how flash sale happens offline and how it mimics the similar behavior) and makes it fun throughout.\n\nThough Arpit does 90% of the things, you still need to do 10% which will help you in long run,\n1. Read the pre-reads that he shares every week.\n2. Ask questions - Arpit loves answering them even if it is dumb. Also, one question doesn't have one correct answer. Express your thoughts about the problem/solution, Arpit will listen, learn and improvise it for next cohort. He added at least 2 new cool stuff based on learning from the past cohorts.\n3. Take note of keywords or new concepts and explore them later. 40 hours is never enough for Arpit to teach you everything.\n4. Try to implement whatever is possible.\n5.

Arpit was quick to debunk that this wasnt a course but a cohort, this wouldnt be a course that aims to equip you to better at interviews but looks at the fundamentals of systems and teases out patterns that could be applied everywhere.\n\nTrue to his pitch, the cohort went into deep details of why systems behave the way they do & how to develop a framework for building these systems. There are lots of engineers who know a lot of tech, but only a handful who can articulate it and even few who can weave a story and a structure out of it - Arpit evidently is part of the latter.

The discussions usually started with a clear description of the problem to be solved, followed by an open ended discussion and then an extensive discussion of the optimal solution. The best thing about this approach is that, it helped me understand the thinking that could have possibly gone behind designing a particular system, rather than just understanding how it was designed.\n\nAnother aspect is that, most resources on the internet either focused on the high level ideas on designing a system or on the specifics of how to implement a system/feature using a particular product. But, in these course, Arpit blends both these aspects very well. It helped me gain a holistic understanding of the high level design, what products can be used, why and how to use them.\n\nOn a personal note, Arpit is a truly curious engineer and a passionate teacher.

I loved Arpit's methodology of not just approaching a system from a bird's eye view but instead going into details of how it could be implemented as well, and trying to dissect every aspect of what can go wrong, and brainstorming over how it could be dealt with.\n\nEven in a problem that seemed simple at the surface, there was always something new to learn. The cohort structure enabled a great community of folks to come together and collaborative learning happened. The mechanism of teaching is very different from several other courses or content that I have gone through in the past. It was ensured that none of the questions were left unanswered, even if that meant stretching the session by an hour. Going the extra mile made a lot of difference in the overall experience. The part I loved the most was having thorough discussions with the entire cohort about a single topic or problem, which made the overall experience quite fun.\n\nThe entire session was surely challenging with all the assignments.
