Arpit has changed everything for me and helped me to develop intuitions for designing the systems at scale. This course was a perfect mixture of theory that we needs to know for understanding and designing massive systems, and real world examples for implementing those concepts. This course is not like any other courses out there, its not one way video based communication as it is cohort based, it provides the experience of solving the problem in real world like a team of 45 engineers working together to solve a problem which in itself was a  awesome experience .It was a great learning experience for me and would recommend the course to everyone who wants to develop understanding of how massive systems functions.",

The two best parts about the course are the discussion and brainstorming between the amazing folks of Cohorts and the 1:1 mentorship from Arpit. Overall if you are prepping for interviews you will get an amazing head start. Or if you want to get better at system design in general this is the best thing you have got.

Even if someone has watched all the system design videos out there, there would be moments of amazement and would help connect the dots to various pieces of puzzles out there in production systems. The final cheery on top is the Mentorship session which Arpit provides for any abstract discussions outside the course content as well.
